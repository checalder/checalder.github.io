The role would be foucsed on inforamtics and data analysis so I thought it would show some self initiative to create a small matplot lib python program to analyse some NHS data, perhaps I should also practice my SQL skills some, hopefully this leaves a good impression in my interview in a few days... fingers crossed! </p>

                            <a href="Project.html#OS">01/12/2025</a> - Computers on a foundational theoretical level work in a series of combinational logic gates to make decisions, and to better understand this applied logic, i am going through a reccomended course called <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer">nand2tetris</a> on coursera. The goal is essentially to make the various chips such as MUX, ANDs, ORs and more complex chips such as MUX32 chips which take multiple input bits and multiplex them. This is an important prerequisite to better prepare my understanding of computing down to the physical level. I have been creating these logic chips in hardware simulator software, first by drawing diagrams then implementing the logic within code and it is very interesting.

So far I have been reviewing my conditional logic and developing my understing of electrical engineering, mainly at allaboutcircuits.com. This should be a crucially helpful course to improve my fundamental understanding of computers and their architecture, something i already know a thing or two about and would like to apply my knowledge practically, really consolidate and build upon it.

I have put this in its own page called <a href="Cat.html">Cat.html</a> To do this, I had to learn about asyncrounous functions and the different ES6 and ES8 versions of javascript.</p>

                            <a href="Projects.html#zelda"> 14/06/2023</a> - Now the problem with the third person camera is that the character is always over the shoulder of the player. This is fine apart from when the player wants to run away but still be able to move the camera to look around independantely like in an open world game such as GTA or, as is the ultimate goal of this project, The legend of zelda. I will be working on this next.

                            <a href="Projects.html#zelda">10/06/2023</a> - To start with, I have been experimenting with the camera and control types. The objecitve was to make the camera move with the mouse which is much harder than you might expect. I have had to delve much deeper into unity's new input system which can get very complicated. Then use the input to alter the rotation of the camera. This is difficult to do because the camera rotation values are in quaternions and quaternions should never be directly altered in unity unless absolutely neccesary. Thus i had to convert values back and forth between vector3s and quaternions which got very complicated, however, now i have a working camera system that can be re-used in any first person or 3rd person game i make.

                            <a href="Projects.html#animal run">21/03/2023</a> - I added boss music and victory music aswell as a final secret 6th level that is only accessed upon beating level 5. The 6th level goes on forever and gets harder over time so no matter what you will lose eventually, but this allows players to get their own unique highscore past the winscreen. Furthermore, I have finetuned the animal speed and spawn rates on each of the levels to be more fair but also challenging - I think i have it just right. Overall, I feel finished with this project and am very satisfied with how it is now.
